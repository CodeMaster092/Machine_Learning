----------------------------------------------------------------Emotion Detection Using CNN------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Around 35000 Images were used to train the Convolutional Neural Network to identify the 7 different emotions.
Used Accuracy and Confusion matrix as the eveluation metrics.
Created additional Data of around 70,000 images for the model to understand better using Data Augmentation.
