--------------------------------------------------------------TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Built a Neural Network to predict the sentiment of a given tweet. 
Text data is converted to vectors using TextVectorization. A layer of TextVectorization is added to the neural network 
which converts the tweet messages to vectors which are then fed to next layers for tarining. 
100000 samples each were taken for positive and negative.
The confusion matrix and accuracy are used as evaluation measures.
